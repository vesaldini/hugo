I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://sites.tufts.edu/physics/) at [Tufts University](http://www.tufts.edu/) and I work with [David Hammer](http://dhammer.phy.tufts.edu/home/index.html/) to study how students' views of knowledge impact their learning in physics. I have also been co-teaching a series of three online professional development courses for science teachers that enable them to experience scientific inquiry, then pay attention to their students' inquiry, and finally explore how to [teach responsively](http://cipstrends.sdsu.edu/responsiveteaching/overview.html).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in learning how to create spaces in which people can develop capacities to serve and uplift themselves and their communities, and this begins by considering how minds work.

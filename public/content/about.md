I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://sites.tufts.edu/physics/) at [Tufts University](http://www.tufts.edu/) and I am working with [David Hammer](http://dhammer.phy.tufts.edu/home/index.html/). I study how students' views of knowledge impact their thinking and behavior in quantum mechanics.
